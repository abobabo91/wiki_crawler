### **Wikipedia Crawling AI Bot** 

This Python project creates an **AI Wikipedia explorer** that autonomously browses Wikipedia pages. The bot simulates curiosity by selecting links based on its "interests" and keeps track of its browsing history.  

### **How It Works:**  
1. **Starts at Wikipedia's homepage** and scrapes content & links.  
2. **Asks GPT** to choose an interesting link and explain why.  
3. **Follows the chosen link** and repeats the process.  
4. **Maintains a history** of visited pages & reasons for choosing them.  
5. (Optional) Can **search for a specific topic** by navigating links efficiently.
   
### **Features:**  
**Autonomous browsing** – GPT picks topics it finds interesting.  
**Self-learning exploration** – Tracks reasoning for each choice.  
**Goal-based mode** – Finds a target topic in the shortest path.
